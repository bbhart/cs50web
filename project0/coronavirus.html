    <h2>Mar 30, 2020</h2>
    <p>Took a few days off from the journal.</p>
    <p>At this point, I can't imagine the kids will go back to school this school year. We'll miss all those spring activities we usually look forward to, plus my son's graduation from elementary school this year. Actually... will they even graduate? They won't have fulfilled the requirements to move on. Will curriculums nationwide flex to accomodate these kids missing several months of fundamental education? Questions, questions.</p>
    <p>As for work, I wouldn't expect to be back in an office for at least six more weeks, putting us into the middle of May. I do spend a lot of time wondering what lessons LinkedIn and other Bay Area companies will learn from this, and how it will impact the culture. One would have to assume meal service in its current form would be discontinued, though perhaps there would be prepackaged takeaway food available. Gyms shuttered, too. Further, the large tech companies tend <strong>not</strong> to be fans of hiring remote engineers (though good workers are sometimes allowed to transition from office to remote after a few years in the office), and at my company, as far as I'm aware, there are no work-from-home engineering managers (well, technically, there are currently hundreds, but it's strongly embedded in the culture that managing is done from offices).</p>
    <p>It's a little premature to be wondering about going back to the office, I know. I will say that my own team has done a stellar job of keeping projects moving forward from home during these difficult times, and I'm fortunate to manage these dedicated engineers.</p>
    <p>Switching gears.</p>
    <p>As of March 29, Santa Clara County had recorded 848 total cases and 28 deaths. (<em>Note from the county: The 202 new confirmed cases reported today include some results that were not previously reported over the past two days. This increase reflects a reporting delay, not necessarily a significant single day increase.</em>)</p>

    <p>This <strong>United States</strong> dashboard from <a href="https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections" rel="nofollow">HealthData.org</a> shows that the country will face a severe bed and ICU bed shortage within the next two weeks.</p>
    <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/bbhart/writing/blob/master/assets/2020-mar-30-healthdatadashboard.png"><img src="https://github.com/bbhart/writing/raw/master/assets/2020-mar-30-healthdatadashboard.png" alt="USA-wide dashboard shows bed and ICU bed shortage predictions" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
    <p>This <strong>California</strong> dashboard from the same site shows no predicted shortages of beds or ICU beds. The quick way to read this is that you <strong>don't</strong> want the dotted line (predicted need) to go higher than the solid line of the same color (availability).</p>

    <p>Then compare to <strong>New York</strong>, which is astonishing.</p>
    <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/bbhart/writing/blob/master/assets/2020-mar-30-sccdashnewyork.png"><img src="https://github.com/bbhart/writing/raw/master/assets/2020-mar-30-sccdashnewyork.png" alt="New York map shows resources vastly overwhelmed" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
    <p>One other note about these projections: "The projections assume the continuation of strong social distancing measures and other protective measures." There are still states not taking as hard a line as others.</p>

    <p>My wife's parents drove <strong>direct</strong> from west central Florida to central Nova Scotia on Sunday-into-Monday, getting ahead of the looming coronavirus disaster set to hit Florida (plus wanting to stay ahead of a major snowstorm). Then I read this article today: <a href="https://www.macleans.ca/society/life/escape-from-florida-my-2400-km-drive-back-to-the-sanity-of-canada/" rel="nofollow">Escape from Florida: My 2,400-km drive back to the sanity of Canada</a>. Her folks will be in self-quarantine for the next 14 days, and their neighbors (excuse me, <em>neighbours</em>) have kindly offered to fetch and drop groceries for them. My parents and my brother and his family are still isolating at their places in eastern Tennessee. Speaking of my parents, I did ask them if they'd be willing to forgo quarantine and risk death in order to create shareholder value, but they passed on that idea.</p>

    <h2>Mar 24, 2020</h2>
    <p>It wasn't a good day overall. Lots of negative thoughts and despair. The person I was mentioning yesterday tested <em>negative</em> for COVID-19 but then I learned later in the day someone in my extended family tested positive (but is doing OK for the moment, thankfully). Being home-bound since March 5 and fairly anxious <strong>the whole time</strong> is having a physical impact on me. I have low-grade headache and tremors for a good portion of the day, and I'm more prone to mood swings. I'm prescribing myself longer and more frequent walks to try to cope.</p>
    <p>Anyway, the next two weeks will be a shit show here in the US. Strap in.</p>

    <p>I am now likely one-degree connected to someone with COVID-19; this person is symptomatic and has taken a test, but the results haven't come back yet. We haven't been near each other physically since the first few days of March. And no, this person hasn't lost their sense of taste or smell; I asked. At this point they are managing the symptoms well and statistically they have an almost 100% chance of making a full recovery.</p>

    <p>Here in a 9 county area of Northern California -- including Santa Clara County, where we live -- we've been in a shelter-in-place order for a few days now, though I've been in shelter mode since March 5 when LinkedIn sent us home. Well, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/california-governor-issues-statewide-shelter-in-place-order-2020-03-19" rel="nofollow">this evening California's governor extended shelter-in-place to the rest of California</a>, impacting some 40 million people. We can still leave homes for essential needs like food or medical care, and we can still receive deliveries from Amazon and restaurants. We can also get out and go for walks, and the kids can play in the yard, which may help preserve our sanity. <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13019040?s=67&amp;sharer_id=7285002&amp;unique_share_id=5d9b5798-ad0c-43db-83ac-8acab29fcc19" rel="nofollow">Something like this, in the woodsy mountains and away from it all</a> is starting to look pretty appealing.</p>
    <p>I've been feeling under the weather all day today. My energy level dropped off a cliff mid-morning, I've been doing "catch up" breaths and swallowing more than usual. In the afternoon I was running a faint fever (99.2 / 99.3) but it's possible that was just anxiety, which has been a challenge the past few weeks. I say all that, but I had a banana muffin and ice cream sandwich and felt <em>much</em> better after, so maybe it was blood sugar? I'll give it a few days and see.</p>

    <h2>Mar 13, 2020</h2>
    <p>I took a mental health day off from work today, and made a concerted effort to <strong>put the phone down</strong> for a good portion of the day. My anxiety has put me in a bad place over the past two weeks, and I strongly attribute it to mainlining coronavirus news. Work-from-home and the wicked stomach bug last weekend ended up with me only leaving the house for ~30 minutes over the past 8 days. Between a virtual happy hour yesterday evening with 9 or 10 work mates, my disconnecting from the news somewhat, and going on a long mountain drive today, I've been able to reset some.</p>
    <p>Why am I so anxious? Statistically, me, my wife, and our kids will eventually catch coronavirus, feel shitty for a bit, and emerge completely fine on the other end. The anxiety stems from the perfect storm of pandemic disease, economic upheaval, and a federal government that is incompetent beyond measure. There is no template for this, and our government seems to be lacking the bright minds at the top who would be able to competently steer the ship in times of uncertainty. So I'm anxious not for me or my family, but for the people who will be injured or killed by a system that should've done a much, much better job.</p>

    <h2>Mar 7, 2020</h2>
    <p>I needed a few days away from writing, though I've been spending a considerable amount of time reading and conversing about coronavirus.</p>
    <p>Let's start with this:</p>
    <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/bbhart/writing/blob/master/assets/2020-mar-7-capacity.jpg"><img src="https://github.com/bbhart/writing/raw/master/assets/2020-mar-7-capacity.jpg" alt="US healthcare system capacity illustration" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
    <p>I suspect this is why my employer -- and many others in this area -- have either mandated or strongly encouraged their employees to work from home. It's an assumption that we'll <em>all</em> be coming down with COVID-19 but that it needs to be spread out in order to have sufficient resourcing to keep the business running.</p>
    <p>For me, there are two schools of thought here:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Catch coronavirus sooner rather than later, so that if I do need to see a doctor, I can do so before the health system gets overstressed. Not saying that I'd <em>actively seek out</em> to get COVID-19, but that I wouldn't be Howard Hughes paranoid about germs.</li>
    <li>Go full hermit to push back catching it as long as possible. It would have to be timed so that it's below the dotted line above. This means staying in, not letting the kids have friends over, eating from our stock of food, and probably getting on each other's nerves a lot. The idea here is to give the healthcare system a chance to scale up and/or work through cases, and scientists time to develop a vaccine.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This cannot be contained at this point. US political leaders are either in denial or too stupid to realize this (flip a coin).</p>

    <p>Definitely an escalation in response today, at least here in the SF Bay Area and in Seattle.</p>
    <p>LinkedIn (my employer) this evening advised that "all Bay Area employees who are in a job that can be done from home should do so through the end of March, unless further guidance is provided."</p>
    <p>A friend in the Seattle area shared this evening that his daughter's school district has closed schools indefinitely. They're going to switch to <a href="https://classroom.google.com/u/0/" rel="nofollow">Google Classroom</a>.</p>
    <p>Our broken federal government is going to treat it like the Puerto Rico hurricane. This virus will disproportionately impact the most vulnerable among us, who can't afford to take time off from work, or afford to get tested, or even arrange care for their child whose school has been shut down. The school district may do remote classes, but the family might not be able to afford a laptop and Internet to connect.</p>

    <h2>Mar 3, 2020</h2>
    <p>"Unusual times."</p>
    <p>There was a video circulating around a month ago where drones in China were harassing people who were out during quarantine. The drones had speakers attached and nearby pilots would inform people they should go home, wash their hands, and put on their masks. It was an interesting use of tech -- novel but also a little dystopian. The phrase "these are unusual times" is heard a few times. Maybe it's the translation, but it's a phrase that's stuck with me the past four weeks, and one I find myself uttering to myself more and more.</p>

    <p>Our internal #coronavirus slack channel exploded today, jumping from ~80 in the morning to ~250 by end of day. As you might imagine, there was lots of chatter there all day.</p>
    <p>Coronavirus precautions at work are a mixed bag. "Foot grabs" have magically appeared on restroom doors in the last day or so, which is fine for my building, but less fine for the buildings with latching restroom door handles. There are additional hand sanitizer stations at the entrances to our cafes now, but nobody posted to strongly encourage (or guilt) people into using them. (They could learn some lessons from the cruise industry here, where they're pretty militant about it.) Office supply cabinets have been raided for hand sanitizers. I have some at my desk I used a few times, and I've been focused on not touching my face.</p>
    <p>Lastly, an email went out to all of LinkedIn's ~14,000+ employees late in the evening from our head of HR sharing updates on how the company is managing coronavirus response. Several sales offices around the world are closed out of an abundance of caution, and HR opened the door for people who wish to work from home from now until March 9 (a date which I assume will be extended).</p>
    <p>Unusual times.</p>
    <h2>Mar 2, 2020</h2>
    <p>I woke up at 3am feeling very warm despite us keeping the house at 62F overnight. Sleep was hit-and-miss from there on until I roused the kids at 6:50am. It didn't occur to me to check my temperature until 8:15am or so; I figured I was miserable from bad sleep. Ear thermometer read 100.7 in one ear and 101.1 in the other. I stayed home from work. A mid-afternoon check showed me at 102.1.</p>
    <p>As of 2:45pm, my symptoms are 102.1 fever and very mild joint aches. Breathing seems fine. Sinuses are somewhat caked but not necessarily worse than average for the dry air here.</p>

It's not clear how much time elapsed between when the patient was admitted and the CDC ordered the test, and I haven't dug further.</li>

    <p>Picked up a little more food to have around the house, but not to full prepper level or anything.</p>
    <p>Today I'm around 80% confident schools will close either late this week (start date of 3/5 or 3/6) or early next week, either
    through direct action of the CUSD School Board, or indirectly due to unprecedented absences.</p>

    <p>The above were posted while I was at work. I headed toward home around 6:15pm and stopped at Smart &amp; Final, which
    is a hybrid grocery/warehouse store near the house. Many canned vegetables were picked over, lots of beans still available,
    and most of the bulk bags of rice were gone.</p>
    <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/bbhart/writing/blob/master/assets/2020-feb-28-smartfinal.png"><img src="https://github.com/bbhart/writing/raw/master/assets/2020-feb-28-smartfinal.png" alt="Empty shelves at south Sunnyvale Smart and Final store" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
    <p>The store was above-average busy, and they had 3 registers going... unusual for this store.</p>
    <p>No actual evidence for this, but my gut tells me Santa Clara County probably went over the tipping point a few days ago
    and we just haven't realized it yet.</p>
